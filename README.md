# LITA-Final-Project
## Project Tiltle: Customer Segment For Subscription Service
### Project Overview
---
The  purpose of this project is to analyze customer data for a subscription service to identify segments and trends, understand customer behavior, track subscription types, and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals. By analyzing the various parameters in the data received, the goal is to gather sufficient insights to make reasonable decisions enabling us to tell compelling stories around the data. This analysis is centered around discovering the revenue trends, customer behavior, and subscription patterns across the various regions and also aids in identifying the key performance indicators from our data.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of the Data used is Customer Data .xlxs. made available by LITA DATA ANALYSIS BOOTCAMP, an online training class.

### Data Collected
---
The data collected contains the following key columns needed to perform the analysis:
- Customer ID: Set of numbers giving to uniquely identify each customer
- Customer Name: the name of each customer
- Region: the specific location where customers reside to make transactions.
- Subscription type: preferred type of subscription by customers
- Subscription Start: the onset of subscription
- Subscription End: the time to which the subscription finished
- Canceled: whether the subscription was discontinued or not
- Revenue: the amount of money generated by subscriptions
- Subscription duration: the duration to which the subscription lasted

### Objectives
---
This project was designed to address the following analysis goal:
- Total customers  by Region: To determine the total number of customers from each region
- Revenue by Subscription Type: Determine the sum of revenue by subscription type
- Subscription Type by Region and customer ID: Determine the type of subscription from each region and the number of customers subscribing to it.
- Average subscription Duration by customer ID: to determine the average duration of subscription by each customer
- Number of canceled subscriptions  by region and  customerID: to determine the regions and customers who had canceled subscriptions.

### Key Performance Metrics
---
key metrics are quantifiable measurements relevant for tracking performance/progress and making informed decisions. The following metrics were used:
- Total Revenue
- Revenue: sum of revenue grouped by subscription type and regions
- Subscription Type: grouped by revenue and customer ID
- Average subscription Duration: grouped by customer id
- Subscription cancellations: number of canceled subscriptions grouped by region and customerID.

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel 
  1. For data cleaning 
  2. For analysis
  
- SQL Server
  1. For exploratory Data analysis
     
- Power BI
  1. For Data Analysis and DAX
  2. For data visualization

### Data Cleaning and Prepaions
---
At the initial phase the following actions were performed:
- Data loading and Inspection
- Handling missing variables
- Handling duplicate rows and columns
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
This involved the exploration of the data to answer certain question  such as;
- What is  the total number of customers from each region?
- What is  the most popular subscription type by the number of customers? 
- Find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
- What is  the average subscription duration for all customers? 
- Find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- What is the total revenue by subscription type?
- Find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
- What is the total number of active and canceled subscriptions

### Formula Used
---
These are formular/queries used to analyze and generate this report, starting from Microsoft Excel, SQL Server, and Power BI respectively:

```Microsoft Excel
Subscription duration= DAYS(subscription end-subscription start)
```

```SQL
SELECT Region, COUNT(Distinct CustomerID) AS Number_of_Customers
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData 1] 
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY 2 DESC

SELECT SubscriptionType, COUNT(Distinct CustomerID) AS Popular_Subscription FROM [dbo].[CustomerData 1]
Group by SubscriptionType

SELECT CustomerName
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData 1]
WHERE Canceled = 1
AND DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd) <= 6;

SELECT 
    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, SubscriptionStart, ISNULL(SubscriptionEnd, GETDATE()))) AS average_subscription_duration
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData 1]

SELECT 
    customerID,
  SubscriptionStart,
  SubscriptionEnd,
    DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, ISNULL(SubscriptionEnd, GETDATE())) AS subscription_duration_months
FROM 
    [dbo].[CustomerData 1]
WHERE 
    DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart, ISNULL(SubscriptionEnd, GETDATE())) > 12

SELECT  SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue
FROM [dbo].[CustomerData 1]
Group BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY 2 DESC

SELECT TOP 3 
    Region,
    COUNT(*) AS cancellation_count
FROM 
    [dbo].[CustomerData 1]
WHERE 
    Canceled = 1
GROUP BY 
    Region
ORDER BY 
    cancellation_count DESC

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_active_subscriptions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Canceled = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_cancelled_subscriptions
FROM 
   [dbo].[CustomerData 1] 
```

```Power BI
Average subscription Duration = AVERAGE(CustomerData[Subscription Duration])

CancellationsWithin6Months = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(CustomerData),CustomerData[Canceled Value] = 1,
    DATEDIFF(CustomerData[SubscriptionStart], CustomerData[SubscriptionEnd], MONTH) <= 6)

Count of Subscription Cancellations = COUNTROWS(FILTER('CustomerData', 'CustomerData'[Canceled Value] = 1))

Total number of cancelled subscription = CALCULATE(COUNT(CustomerData[Canceled Value]), CustomerData[Canceled Value] = 1)

Total number of current subscription = CALCULATE(COUNT(CustomerData[Canceled Value]), CustomerData[Canceled Value] = 2)

DateTable = CALENDAR(MIN(CustomerData[SubscriptionStart]),MAX(CustomerData[SubscriptionEnd]))

Year = YEAR(DateTable[Date])
```

A. Key Observations:
- The overall observation in the total revenue shows that there was a significant decline in revenue generation across the years. In 2022 the total revenue generated is approximately 41 million which is higher than the total revenue generated in 2023 that is approximately 27 million.

B. Interpretation and Implications:
- The total revenue for the  year 2022 shows favorable market conditions and economic climate. However the decline in the total revenue over the years indicates the need for tactical assessments of services provided. There is a need to investigate the cause of this decline which may be market or product competition and change in customer behavior.

A. Key observation:
- Revenue by subscription type : the data shows that the basic subscription type with a total revenue of approximately 34 million (33,776,735) has the highest revenue for both years,accounting for 50.1% of the total revenue generated. The premium subscription type with the second highest revenue of approximately 17 million(16,899,064) accounting for 25.02% of total revenue generated slightly outperforming the standard subscription type with a total of 17 million(16,864,376) accounting for 24.97% of total revenue generation for both years. However there is a significant decline in revenue generation in 2023 by all 3 subscription types as seen from the filtered chart.
  
- Revenue by Region: evaluating the regional performance for the year 2022 base on revenue generated shows that  the Eastern region generated the highest total revenue of 10,242,555m accounting for 25.27% of total revenue generated that year slightly outperforming the other regions. The southern region had a total revenue of 10,126,800m accounting for 24.98% of revenue generated , the Northern region has a revenue of 10,089,951 accounting for 24.89% of revenue generated, the  Western region is the least in generating revenue with a value 10, 079,132m accounting for 24.86% of revenue generated. However in 2023 all regions experienced a significant decline in revenue generated but the East still remained the highest revenue generator.

B. Interpretation and Implication:
- The decline in revenue generation by the various subscription types in 2023 suggest unfavorable market and economic climate conditions, change in consumer demand and preferences which could be why customers reduced their subscription rate. The need to focus on underperforming subscription types such as the standard subscription type  by offering customer Centric services, leveraging on technology and digital transformation such as automation which can help streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve service quality. Faster, attracts and retains customers leading to increased revenue generation.
  
- The high performance of the East region in terms of revenue generation suggests a favorable market conditions and economic climate and a consumer care reletionship and experiences. Expanding marketing efforts such as digital Marketing and social media engagement putting the service provided in limelight in the underperforming region can help balance revenue distribution.

C. Conclusion:
- The data shows a decline in revenue generation by both regions and subscription types. This culminates the need for the service providing company to analyze market and economic conditions and also implement strategies suggested to increase the rate of subscription and in turn increase revenue generation most especially in the North  and west  regions.

A. Key Observations:
- the data showed that there are 20 distinct customers who repeatedly subscribed to a particular service or product. The most preferred  subscription type by customers as seen from the data is the basic subscription type with a total   6 distinct  customers in 2022 however there is a decrease in the number of subscribers in 2023 with only 4 customers subscribing to it. The Premium subscription type came second  and the standard subscription type is the least. All the various subscription types experience a decrease in the number of subscribers in 2023.

B. Interpretation and Implications:
- The maintenance of the most preferred subscription type which is the basic subscription type may be due to factors like fair pricing and consumer behavior, Enhanced Service Delivery, Speed and Quality. The underperformance of the remaining subscription types may suggest  unfavorable market conditions, pricing pressures and increased market competitors.

c. Conclusion: 
- The data shows the most preferred subscription type being the Basic subscription type with a decrease in the number of subscribers across the years. This indicates a need for the company to analyze market conditions, customer behavior and improve marketing strategies to decrease competitors which in turn will increase subscription rate. The standard subscription type should be reviewed in terms of pricing and services delivered.

In 2022, the south accounted for 60.21% of the total subscription cancelation, the North accounted for 20.03% of total subscription cancellations and the West region which is the least accounted for about 19.76% of the total canceled subscriptions. However in 2023 only two regions(North and West ) had canceled subscriptions with a percentage of 50 each.

B.Interpretation and Implications:
- The  decline in the number of active subscribers in 2023  indicates a need for strategizing  business policies. The need for tactical assessment of the cause of decline which may be due to changes in customer behavior, poor customer experiences and support, unmet expectations and lack of percieved values. Other reasons could be market conditions such as increased competition and economic climate. Therefore there is a need to engage in effective customer retention strategies like offering retention incentives such as discount, loyalty rewards and personalized recommendations which can keep customers motivated to keep subscribing. Also increase marketing and branding efforts, streamline services provided to fit into the cultural and social trends of the regions.
- The customer retention rate for both years shows a 55% retention, indicating a positive and favorable business growth as this accounts for more than half of the 100% retention rate.
- The lack of cancellation in the southern region in 2023 showed that the region thrived due to favorable market conditions,  the high cancellation rate in the North and West region indicates that there is need for critical assessment of  how business procedures are carried out in those regions, this could be poor customer experiences and relationship which needs to be improved.

C. Conclusion:
- There is a  decrease in the number of active subscribers and the constant cancellation in the Northern and Western regions which indicates the need for analyzing  market and economic conditions and also implement strategies suggested to boost customer retention and subscription rate.
